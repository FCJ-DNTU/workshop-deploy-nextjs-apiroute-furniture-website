#### What is a DB Subnet Group?

A **DB Subnet Group** in Amazon DocumentDB is a collection of subnets within a VPC, used to define which subnets the DocumentDB cluster can be deployed in. Each DB Subnet Group must contain **at least two subnets in different Availability Zones (AZs)** to ensure high availability and redundancy.

#### Why Create a DB Subnet Group?

- **Supports Deployment in a VPC**: A DB Subnet Group allows you to specify a **VPC and designated subnets** for deploying an Amazon DocumentDB cluster, improving network control and security.

- **Ensures High Availability & Redundancy**: Amazon DocumentDB requires **at least two subnets across different Availability Zones (AZs)** to provide fault tolerance. If one AZ fails, the cluster can continue operating in the remaining AZ.

- **Automatic Failover Handling**: If the **primary instance** fails, DocumentDB can automatically promote a **replica instance** in another subnet as the new primary. A new replica is then created in the previous subnet to maintain the required number of nodes.

#### Create a DB Subnet Group on AWS

Follow these steps to create a **DB Subnet Group** on AWS:

1. Go to the **AWS Management Console**.

2. Search for and select the **Amazon DocumentDB** service.

3. In the navigation menu, select [Subnet groups](https://ap-southeast-1.console.aws.amazon.com/docdb/home?region=ap-southeast-1#subnetGroups).

4. In **Subnet groups**, click **Create**.

5. In the **Create DB Subnet Group** page:

   - **Name**: `nextjs-db-subnet-group`.
   - **Description**: `nextjs-db-subnet-group`.
   - Select the VPC you are using.
   - In the **Add Subnets** section, choose the **Private Subnets**:
     - Select **at least two Private Subnets in different AZs** (e.g., subnet-xxxxxx1 in AZ **us-east-1a**, subnet-xxxxxx2 in AZ **us-east-1b**).
     - Click **Add subnet**.

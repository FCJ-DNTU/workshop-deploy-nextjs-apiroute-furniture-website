#### Amazon EC2

**Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)** is a cloud computing infrastructure provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that offers on-demand virtual computing resources.

#### Amazon EC2 Instance

An **Amazon EC2 Instance** is a cloud server. With an AWS account, you can create and use multiple Amazon EC2 Instances. These instances run on the same physical server and share memory, CPU, storage, etc.

#### EC2 Deployment Model in the Workshop

In this workshop, we will initialize an EC2 Instance to run a Next.js Fullstack application with API Routes. EC2 will act as an Application Server handling both the Frontend and Backend.

### Why choose **t2.medium**:

- **Balanced performance and cost:**
  - t2.medium provides 2 vCPUs and 4GB RAM, sufficient to run a Next.js Fullstack application (including API Routes).
  - t2.medium provides 2 vCPUs and 4GB RAM, sufficient to run a Next.js Fullstack application (including API Routes).
- **Supports Burstable Performance:** T2 instances are Burstable Performance Instances, meaning they can increase CPU performance when needed.
- **Scalability:** If expansion is needed, switching to t3.medium or m5.large is easy without changing the architecture.

**In this workshop, we will choose the t2.medium instance on an On-Demand basis in the ap-southeast-1 (Singapore) region**
| On-Demand hourly rate | vCPU | Memory |
| ----------------------- | -----| -------|
| $0.0584 | 2 | 4 GiB |

**Why Choose On-Demand Instances:** Pay per use without long-term commitments.

**Estimated Cost Using On-Demand:**

- t2.medium (2 vCPUs, 4GB RAM): **$0.0584/hour**
- If running 24/7 (730 hours/month): **~$42.63/month**

**ðŸ‘‰ Cost Optimization:** Only turn on EC2 when needed, turn it off when not in use.

#### Create an EC2 Instance

####1. Access AWS Console

- Open a browser and go to the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.

#### 2. In the **Dashboard**, select **Launch instance**

![Launch.png](/images/4-create-ec2-instance/4.1.png)

#### 3. Name the Instance

- In the **Name and tags** section:

  - **Name:** `nextjs-ec2`

#### 4. Select an Image (Amazon Machine Image - AMI)

- Under Application and OS Images (Amazon Machine Image), follow these steps:

  - Select **Quick Start**, then choose **Ubuntu**. This is the operating system (OS) for your instance.

  - From Amazon Machine Image (AMI), select **Ubuntu 24.04 LTS HVM**. Note that this AMI is marked as **Free tier eligible**. An Amazon Machine Image (AMI) is a base configuration used as a template for your instance.

#### 5. Choose an Instance Type

- In Instance type, select **t2.medium**, then under **Key pair (login)**, select **Create new key pair**
  ![instance.png](/images/4-create-ec2-instance/4.3.png)

#### 6. Create a Key Pair

- In **Create key pair**, enter the following information:

  - **Key pair name**: `nextjs-kp`

  - **Key pair type**: Select **RSA**

  - **Private key file format**: **.pem**

  - Then click **Create key pair**. A **.pem** file will automatically be downloaded to your computer

{{% notice warning %}}
Warning: Do not select Proceed without a key pair (Not recommended). If you create an instance without a key pair, you will not be able to connect to it.
{{% /notice %}}

#### 7. Configure Security Group

- In **Network settings**, click **Edit** next to it. For Security group name, select a security group that you created during setup by following these steps:

  - Select **Select existing security group**.

  - From Common security groups, choose your security group from the list.

  - Confirm and launch the instance.

  - Keep the default selections for other instance settings.

  - Review the instance configuration summary in **Summary**, and when ready, click **Launch instance**.

#### 8. Confirm and Check Status

- A notification page will appear indicating that your instance is launching. Click **View all instances** to return to the console.
  ![view.png](/images/4-create-ec2-instance/4.7.png)

- In the **Instances** screen, check the EC2 status:

  - **pending** â†’ booting up

  - **running** â†’ successfully started, has a Public DNS

- Wait a few minutes for EC2 to be ready, check **Status check** to ensure stability.

- View the Public IPv4 at **EC2 Instance** > **Networking** > **Public IPv4 Address**.

#### 9. Connecting to the EC2 Instance

#### 9.1. Connecting via SSH

- Select the created EC2 Instance, then choose **Connect**
  ![connect.png](/images/4-create-ec2-instance/4.9.png)

- In the **Connect to instance** interface, select the **SSH Client** tab.
  ![ssh-client.png](/images/4-create-ec2-instance/4.10.png)

- If using **MacOS**, copy the example SSH command and paste it into **Terminal**:

  ```
  $ chmod 400 "nextjs-kp.pem"
  $ ssh -i path/to/key-pair.pem ubuntu@domain
  ```

- If using **Windows**, install [WSL2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) or use PuTTY tools: [PuTTY Executable
  (putty.exe)](https://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/w64/putty.exe), [SCP Client
  (pscp.exe)](https://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/w64/pscp.exe), [RSA vÃ  DSA Key Generation Utility
  (puttygen.exe)](https://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/w64/puttygen.exe)

**Connecting via PuTTY:**

- Open **puttygen.exe** and **Load** the private key file.

- Convert and save as **nextjs-kp.ppk**.

  ![connect2.png](/images/4-create-ec2-instance/4.12.png)
- Use **putty.exe** to connect using Public IPv4.
